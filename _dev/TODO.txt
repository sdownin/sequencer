## TODO
 - check seqdist methods each work; compatibility with other input arguments (e.g., norm='auto')
 - measures: grouping (compute measures based on input selected)
 - separate 1 model into models for each measure selected to be computed
 - measures: simplicity, motif, unpredictibaility
 - Abbreviated alphabet (or state) name inputs
 - UI measures conditional inputs (select, checkbox) from choice of distance method (index vs. sm)
 - stress test different input data sizes/shapes to errors, bottlenecks
 - save plots (png, etc)
 - add unit tests
 - add info links (e.g., for distance measure, normalization, INDEL, etc.)
